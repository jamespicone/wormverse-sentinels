			<text>Scion didn't move or speak. He walked forward, and ripples extended from his footsteps, soared past us with some strange motive force. The ripple touched the wave, and the tower of water collapsed before it got halfway to us, dropping straight down. Liquid as far as the eye could see was being flattened out into a disquieting stillness by the ripples of Scion's footsteps, like a great pane of glass.</text>

			<text>He tried to move, to raise his blade, only to find his armor refusing to cooperate. It had melted, the joints and joins flowing into one another. His sword wasn't much better. The ceramic properties he'd applied to the edge were heat-resistant, but the remainder of the weapon were growing more nebulous in shape, the hottest parts of the metal flowing down to obscure the edge.</text>

			<text>He'd taken the time one afternoon to solve world hunger. Six hours and twenty-six minutes with the internet and a phone on hand, and he'd been able to wrap his head around the key elements of the problem. He'd drafted a document in the nine hours that followed, doing little more than typing and tracking down exact numbers. A hundred and fifty pages, formatted and clear, detailing who would need to do what, and the costs therein.</text>
