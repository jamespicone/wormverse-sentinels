			<text>He was idly twirling a scepter in his fingers. The scepter wasn't purely thematic â€“ apparently the crowned orb that topped the scepter had two electrodes built into the tines, for the taser that was built into it.</text>

			<text>He was wearing a white mask, not quite as decorative or made up as the ones I associated with the carnivals in Venice, but similar. He'd placed a silver coronet around his short black curls, and wore a ruffled white shirt with skintight leggings tucked into knee-high boots.</text>

			<text>"There's a catch," he spoke. "My power? Once I've figured someone out? It's a lot easier to control them, after. Any time you come near me, I can do this. I can use my power and retake control in the blink of an eye."</text>

			<text>I could envision Regent in a very similar picture. Years older, grown to his full height and proportions, surrounded not by women, but by the people he had claimed as his tools. Capes he controlled with his power.</text>
