			<text>"Just like that. Believe it or not, I've handled worse things than a young woman torn between fatalism and wanting to help her friends stick together. I can't tell you anything about your teammates, but I can arm you with some tools, so your field-therapy is more effective. If that part of you is better equipped, maybe it'll get a bit of an edge in that tug of war that's going on inside your head. Sound good?"</text>

A debate gives them their power back."</text>
