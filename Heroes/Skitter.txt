Skitter: She has real problems with playing cards. Thoughts:
- Either make her bug counter a /supply limit/ instead of a resource that gets expended when playing bugs, give her stuff that increases her supply limit.
- or, more bang for her buck, ways of accelerating her bug gain, ways of acting without bugs (make the bug counter gravy, not her fundamental way of acting)

Tracking bugs suck. Spiders are not amazing. Delivery sucks. Ongoings probably alright. Decoy is nice.

Keep the way bug cards work when you play them, but when they die, add maximum HP back to bug counter. Have ongoings/equipment that add X to maximum bug counter.

Change power to "Play a Bug card".
