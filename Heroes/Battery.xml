			<text>She threw the table like an oversize frisbee, and I pushed Tattletale in one direction as I flung myself in the other. The table edge caught the weapon in Tattletale's hands and knocked it from her grip with enough force to make Tattletale roll as she hit the ground.</text>

			<text>Armsmaster strode away from the Undersiders, and I saw Assault, Battery, Brandish, Night and Fog move to join that group, among others. Smaller than the first group, but I suppose it took a certain amount of bravery to be willing to get close to an Endbringer when you weren't invincible or close to it.</text>

			<text>Battery was charging again, taking advantage of us being off balance to build up a store of power again. Heck, she'd probably built her whole fighting style around it. I could see the normally cobalt blue lines of her costume glowing a brilliant electric blue-white.</text>
