		Stacks her own deck. Anti-stacks hero decks somehow ("Name a card type. Reveal the top N cards of hero decks, discard all cards with that card type"?)
		Cards that get played if they're revealed.
		Traps! Somehow!
		
		Trap deck, condition deck. Deal out H trap cards from the trap deck, put the rest aside. At the start of every villain turn, reveal the top of the condition deck. If the condition on it is met, activate a trap card. Conditions should ideally be visible from current board state - "If a hero has more than X ongoings", "If a hero has two of the same card in hand", "If there are no environment cards in play". Maybe some procedural that are hopefully rememberable?
