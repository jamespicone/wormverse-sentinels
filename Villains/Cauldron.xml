					When Contessa would enter play, you may instead choose one of the following options (as long as it doesn't have a token on it), place a token on it, and then put Contessa on the bottom of the Cauldron deck:
					<ul>
						<li>Put the top 2 cards of the villain deck into play</li>
						<li>This card deals 5 irreducible melee damage to the player with the lowest HP</li>
						<li>Each player destroys one of their cards</li>
						<li>A player destroys all of their cards</li>
						<li>A player discards their hand</li>
