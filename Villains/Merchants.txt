Scratch that idea. Have a deck of Thugs, put separate at the start of play. Play several Thugs from that deck at the end of turn; thugs attack people and maybe have some effects. Thugs return to the Thug deck when destroyed or removed. Lots of cards that put thugs on the field or do things with thugs.

Main villain: Skidmark
	"Superpowered Drug Dealer"
	SETUP
		Place Skidmark in play, "Superpowered Drug Dealer" side up. Search the villain deck for all Thug cards; put them aside as the 'Thug deck'.
		
	GAMEPLAY
		If the Thug deck is empty at the start of the villain turn, the heroes lose the game.
		
		All villain targets take 1 less damage.
		
		At the end of the villain turn, play H - 1 Thugs from the top of the Thug deck.
		
		When this target is destroyed, flip it instead
