Thought: Add advanced text to regular text, make advanced text "At the end of each turn" instead

Flipping a parahuman each turn might be too dangerous - the parahumans are all really unpleasant. Consider Coil: Acting doing something else and setup playing a number of parahumans at game start. Play the top card of the villain deck, so he still plays two villain cards a turn? Reveal something else?

Maybe more mercs, reveal until mercs come out?

Maybe more parahumans that are less threatening, reveal until parahumans come out?

Ongoing/Equipment destruction very unpleasant, maybe make it less absolute, more conditional in some way?
