Version 2.1.0:

Alexandria:
	- Hypersonic Flight now destroys Ongoings or Devices.
	
Armsmaster:
	- Make Quick Adjustment an end-of-turn effect, not a power
	- Change 'Grappling Hook' to 'Grapple' for base-sentinels reasons
	
Battery:
	- Cool Toys now only does anything if you're charged, and it doesn't destroy equipment/devices, and it costs you your charge
	
Dauntless:
	- Charge renamed to Crystallization for base-sentinels reasons
	
Dragon:
	- Change the way focus points work slightly; now Dragon gains 4 at the start of her turn and loses all of them at the end of her turn. This allows gaining focus-points off-turn to do something.
	- Reword Server Farm a bit to try to clarify the intended behaviour
	- Fix Pythios not specifying where non-target revealed cards go.
	- Reword Pythios a bit to reduce the amount of vertical space required (should be no gameplay effect)
	
Guts & Glory:
	- Allow use of incap abilities when only one member is incapacitated.
	- Reword 'No' a bit to make the hero/player distinction clearer and make the reshuffle/draw optional for the case where Panacea uses it on Victoria.
	
Jessica Yamada:
	- Support and Stability now only works the first time each turn; explicitly say 'hero' instead of 'player' on the card.
	
Labyrinth:
	- Clarify that Shaping cards are only environment cards while in play.
	

Behemoth:
	- Clarify where tokens come from for unsourced moves
	- Add damage to Earthquake
	- Change Twisted Wreckage to only remove one of the destroyed cards from the game
	- Add hero target damage to Wildfire
	
Slaughterhouse Nine:
	- Slightly change the text on Jack Slash for hero/player distinction
	
The Simurgh:
	- Add some damage to the unflipped side.
	- Change flipped side to damage all hero targets instead of all heroes
	- Change damage types on a number of cards so she's less locked to psychic damage
	

Lausanne:
	- Rename 'Simurgh' to 'Angelic Figure'
